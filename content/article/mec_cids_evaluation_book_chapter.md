The abstract of this book chapter is as follows:

With the advent of 5th Generation (5G) of mobile networks, a diverse range of new computer networking technologies are being devised to meet the stringent demands of applications that require ultra-low latency, high bandwidth and geolocation-based services. Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) is a prominent example of such an emerging technology, which provides cloud computing services at the edge of the network using mobile base stations. This architectural shift of services from centralised cloud data centers to the network edge, helps reduce bandwidth usage and improve response time, meeting the ultra-low latency requirements laid out for 5G. However, MEC also inherits some of the vulnerabilities affecting traditional networks and cloud computing, such as coordinated attacks. Previous works have proposed the use of Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS), specifically Collaborative Intrusion Detection Systems (CIDS), which have proven to be effective in identifying distributed attacks. However, identifying the right CIDS model is not straightforward due to the tradeoff between different factors such as detection accuracy, network overhead, computation and memory overhead. In this chapter, we outline some of the characteristics relevant for evaluating CIDS deployment models and survey existing CIDS architectures in the context of MEC, while presenting novel strategies and architectures of our own.
