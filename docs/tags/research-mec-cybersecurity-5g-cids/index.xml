      <description>This book chapter is published in Springer Nature and is available here
The abstract of this book chapter is as follows:
With the advent of 5th Generation (5G) of mobile networks, a diverse range of new computer networking technologies are being devised to meet the stringent demands of applications that require ultra-low latency, high bandwidth and geolocation-based services. Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) is a prominent example of such an emerging technology, which provides cloud computing services at the edge of the network using mobile base stations.</description>

      <description>This paper was published in IFIP Networking 2020 and is available here
The abstract of this paper is as follows:
With the rapid adoption of next generation networking architectures in 5G, like Multi-Access Edge Computing (MEC), there is a shift in the core processing capabilities to the edge of the network. This helps facilitate higher bandwidth and ultra-low latency responses, but can increase the attack surface for cyber-attacks like Denial of Service (DoS) and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS).</description>
