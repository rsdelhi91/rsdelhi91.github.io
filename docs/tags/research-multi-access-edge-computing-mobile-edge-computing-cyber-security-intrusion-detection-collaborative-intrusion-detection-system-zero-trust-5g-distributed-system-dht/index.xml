      <description>My PhD thesis was uploaded onto The University of Melbourne archive and is available here
The abstract of my thesis is as follows:
With the advent of Fifth Generation (5G) mobile networks, a diverse range of new computer networking technologies are being devised to meet the stringent demands of applications that require ultra-low latency, high bandwidth and geolocation-based services. Multi-Access Edge Computing (MEC) is a prominent example of such an emerging technology, which provides cloud computing services at the edge of the network using mobile base stations.</description>
